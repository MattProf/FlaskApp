what would be a good extension in vs code to assist in typing html faster?

There are several Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions that can help you to type HTML faster:

Emmet: This is built into VS Code by default and doesn't require any extra installation. It provides numerous
abbreviations and shortcuts to write HTML (and CSS) more efficiently. For example, you can type div.container and hit
Tab to expand it into <div class="container"></div>.

Auto Close Tag: This extension automatically adds HTML close tags whenever you finish typing an open tag, which can save
a lot of time.

HTML Snippets: This extension provides numerous snippets for HTML5, including tags, basic structures, scripts, and
links.

HTML Boilerplate: This extension provides a basic HTML boilerplate to get started quickly with a new project.

HTML CSS Support: While not strictly for HTML only, this extension can help to write HTML faster by providing
auto-completion for classes and ids defined in your CSS files.

Live Server: This extension can launch a local development server with live reload feature for static & dynamic pages.
This can significantly speed up the process of viewing your changes.

Remember to review the details of each extension before using it, to ensure it's the right fit for your specific needs.
