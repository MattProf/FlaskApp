<h1>
    How flask handles webpage security
</h1>

<p>
    Creating security features to protect your web application from attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL
    injection is essential. Flask and its related libraries offer several built-in protections against these kinds of
    attacks. Below are some of the ways to improve your web application security:
</p>
<h2>1. Prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):</h2>
<p>
    Jinja2 templates escape special characters by default, which means they canâ€™t be interpreted as HTML. This helps
    prevent
    XSS attacks. However, you should still be cautious with the `|safe` filter, which disables this automatic escaping.
</p>
<h2>2.Prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):</h2>
Use Flask-WTF or Flask-SeaSurf to protect against CSRF attacks. These extensions add CSRF tokens to your forms, and
check submitted forms for the presence of these tokens. CSRF attacks occur when an attacker tricks a victim into
performing an action that the victim didn't intend to do.
<h2>
    3. Prevent SQL Injection:
</h2>
<p>
    If you use SQLAlchemy or another ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) with Flask, it will protect you from SQL injection
    as
    long as you use their query APIs correctly and don't concatenate user input directly into your SQL statements.
</p>

<h2>4. Use HTTPS:</h2>
<p>
    Always use HTTPS instead of HTTP for your website. HTTPS encrypts traffic between the server and the client, which
    helps
    protect against many types of attacks.
</p>

<h2>5. Secure User Passwords:</h2>
<p>
    Always hash and salt passwords, and consider adding a slow down function. Werkzeug, a package used by Flask,
    provides
    tools for password hashing. Don't store plain text passwords.
</p>

<h2>
    6. Session Protection:
</h2>
<p>
    Flask-Login provides session protection out of the box. It protects against stolen user cookies by assigning a new
    session ID to users when they log in.
</p>

<h2>
    7. Limiting Uploads:
</h2>
<p>
    Limit file uploads by size and type to prevent someone from uploading a malicious file to your server.
</p>
<h2>
    8. Input Validation:
</h2>
<p>
    Always validate and sanitize any user input before using it. Never trust user input.
</p>
<h2>
    9. Content Security Policy (CSP):
</h2>
<p>
    Implement a strict CSP. This will help prevent a wide range of attacks, including XSS and other code injection
    attacks.
</p>

<p>
    Remember that web security is a complex field and this list is not exhaustive. You should always keep abreast of the
    latest threats and how to protect against them. Consider consulting with a security expert or firm if you're not
    confident in your ability to secure your site on your own.
