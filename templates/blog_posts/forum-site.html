What are the major user stories in a forum website?
A forum site is typically a place for users to discuss topics of interest, share knowledge, and interact with each
other. Here are some user stories that could apply to a forum website:

For a forum user:

As a user, I want to register and create an account so that I can participate in discussions.
As a user, I want to log in to my account so that I can post questions, reply to discussions, and personalize my
profile.
As a user, I want to browse through different categories and threads so that I can find topics that interest me.
As a user, I want to start a new thread so that I can initiate a discussion on a specific topic.
As a user, I want to reply to a thread so that I can participate in a discussion or provide information.
As a user, I want to quote or mention other users in my posts so that I can directly respond to or reference their
comments.
As a user, I want to upvote or downvote posts so that I can express my opinion about the quality or relevance of the
content.
As a user, I want to receive notifications when someone replies to my thread or post so that I can stay updated on
discussions that involve me.
As a user, I want to private message other users so that I can communicate with them directly.
As a user, I want to report posts or users that violate the forum rules so that the forum remains a safe and respectful
place.
For a forum moderator/admin:

As a moderator, I want to review and approve new threads or posts so that I can maintain the quality of content on the
forum.
As a moderator, I want to manage (edit, move, pin, close, delete) threads and posts so that I can organize the content
and enforce the forum rules.
As a moderator, I want to manage user accounts (warn, ban, modify roles) so that I can maintain order and safety on the
forum.
As an admin, I want to create, edit, or delete categories and sub-forums so that I can structure the forum based on the
needs of the community.
As an admin, I want to manage the forum's settings (permissions, layout, features) so that I can customize the forum to
best serve the community.
As with other types of websites, the specific user stories for a forum site will vary depending on its unique features
and the needs of its users.
