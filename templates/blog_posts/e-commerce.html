<h1>
    What are the major user stories in an e-commerce website?
</h1>

<p>
    User stories are a way of expressing requirements in the form of simple statements from the perspective of the end
    user.
    They help development teams understand what a user needs from a system to perform a certain task. Each user story
    should
    provide a clear benefit to the user and help achieve their goals.
