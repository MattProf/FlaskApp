What are the major user stories in a porfolio site?

A portfolio website typically showcases the work of an individual or a company. Here are some potential user stories for
a portfolio site:

For a visitor:

As a visitor, I want to view a gallery of projects so that I can see examples of the individual's or company's work.
As a visitor, I want to view details of each project (like images, descriptions, the role played, tools used) so that I
can understand the context and quality of the work.
As a visitor, I want to learn about the individual or company (like skills, experience, achievements, philosophy) so
that I can assess their suitability for my needs.
As a visitor, I want to see reviews or testimonials from previous clients or collaborators so that I can evaluate the
reputation of the individual or company.
As a visitor, I want to find contact information or a contact form so that I can reach out for further information,
inquiries, or opportunities.
As a visitor, I want to download a resume or a brochure so that I can have offline access to key information.
For the portfolio owner:

As the portfolio owner, I want to add, edit, or delete projects from the portfolio so that it stays current and
accurately represents my work.
As the portfolio owner, I want to manage the content of my about page (like biography, skills, services) so that it
accurately reflects my professional identity and offerings.
As the portfolio owner, I want to view site analytics (like visitor counts, page views, popular projects) so that I can
understand how users interact with my portfolio and improve it accordingly.
As the portfolio owner, I want to receive messages sent through the contact form so that I can respond to inquiries or
opportunities.
The specific user stories for a portfolio website can vary based on the individual's or company's field of work, the
site's features, and the needs of its users.
