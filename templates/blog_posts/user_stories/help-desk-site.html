What are the major user stories in a help desk site?
A help desk site is typically used to manage customer support requests and provide resources to help users solve common
problems. Here are some potential user stories for a help desk site:

For a customer:

As a customer, I want to submit a new support ticket so that I can get help with a problem.
As a customer, I want to add additional information or comments to my existing ticket so that I can provide more details
or ask follow-up questions.
As a customer, I want to check the status of my support ticket so that I can know when to expect a response or solution.
As a customer, I want to receive notifications when there's an update to my ticket so that I can stay informed about the
progress.
As a customer, I want to search the knowledge base so that I can find solutions to common problems without needing to
submit a ticket.
As a customer, I want to rate and give feedback on the support I received so that the quality of customer service can be
improved.
For a help desk agent:

As an agent, I want to view and manage incoming support tickets so that I can help customers solve their problems.
As an agent, I want to categorize and prioritize tickets so that I can manage my workflow and ensure important issues
are addressed promptly.
As an agent, I want to respond to tickets and update their status so that I can communicate with customers and resolve
their issues.
As an agent, I want to access customer information and ticket history so that I can better understand the context and
provide personalized support.
For a help desk manager/admin:

As a manager, I want to assign tickets to specific agents or teams so that the right expertise is applied to solve each
problem.
As a manager, I want to view and analyze support metrics (like ticket volume, resolution time, customer satisfaction) so
that I can assess the performance of the help desk and make improvements.
As an admin, I want to manage the knowledge base (add, edit, delete articles) so that it stays up-to-date and helpful to
customers.
As an admin, I want to configure the help desk system (set up categories, workflows, notification rules) so that it
supports the needs of the team and customers.
As always, the specific user stories for a help desk site will depend on the particular features and requirements of the
system.
