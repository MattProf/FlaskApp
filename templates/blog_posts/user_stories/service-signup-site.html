What are the major user stories in a sign-up service site?

A website that encourages users to sign up for a service often has different requirements and features than an
e-commerce or content-based website. Here are some potential user stories for such a site:

For a visitor:

As a visitor, I want to learn about the service so that I can understand what it offers and how it can benefit me.
As a visitor, I want to view pricing and plan options so that I can decide which is best for my needs.
As a visitor, I want to see reviews or testimonials from other users so that I can assess the quality and value of the
service.
As a visitor, I want to have access to a FAQ or help section so that I can get answers to common questions about the
service.
For a potential customer:

As a potential customer, I want to sign up for a free trial so that I can test the service before committing to a paid
plan.
As a potential customer, I want to create an account with my email or social media account so that I can access the
service and manage my settings.
As a potential customer, I want to choose a plan and enter payment information so that I can subscribe to the service.
For a customer:

As a customer, I want to manage my account settings (like profile information, payment methods) so that I can keep my
information up-to-date.
As a customer, I want to upgrade, downgrade, or cancel my subscription so that I can control my use of the service and
costs.
As a customer, I want to receive notifications about important account activity (like payment issues, changes to the
service, reminders to renew) so that I can manage my subscription effectively.
As a customer, I want to get customer support so that I can resolve any problems or concerns I have about the service.
For a site admin:

As an admin, I want to manage user accounts (like registration, subscription status, account issues) so that I can
ensure a smooth user experience.
As an admin, I want to view and analyze user metrics (like sign-ups, conversions, cancellations) so that I can
understand user behavior and improve the service.
As an admin, I want to update site content (like service information, pricing, FAQs) so that the site stays current and
accurate.
As with other types of websites, the specific user stories for a service sign-up site will vary depending on its unique
features and the needs of its users.
