<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    My name is Matthew Muhlenkort. As an inventor and gamer at heart, I find my passion in building innovative
    solutions. If I'm not creating something, I am likely yearning for a project to immerse myself into. My most notable
    achievment is the Dynamic Payments software.
</p>

<h2>
    Context & Problem Statement
</h2>
<p>
    During my tenure at Walser Automotive Group, I recognized a significant challenge within the automotive industry:
    dealerships and Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) often struggle with customer trust due to unrealistic and
    unachievable offers that were hard to understand or read.
</p>
<h2>
    Solution & Role
</h2>
<p>
    To address this, I developed the Dealer Marketing Portal renamed Ignite renamed Dynamic Payments, a proprietary
    software currently owned by FUSE Autotech which was established due to the success of the product.
    This tool was designed to give automotive OEMs an unprecedented level of control over the specials generated by
    their branded dealerships.
    The software automatically scans a dealership's entire inventory daily, generating a series of lease and finance
    offers specific to each VIN number.
    Then, these offers are ranked by year, make, and model to provide customers with real-time offers for every vehicle
    on the lot.
</p>
<p>The software presents the offers in a specific sequence, enabling a marketing logic trick when customers view the
    offers.
    In essence, the offers are designed to enhance transparency and empower the customers with a clear understanding of
    the due payments and amount of money owed when signing.
    The key here was to include only offers that were realistically achievable, thus restoring customers' trust and
    creating positive experiences when they arrive at the dealership.</p>
<h2>
    Results
</h2>
<p>
    The results of this approach were transformative. Customers became more relaxed and confident in the dealership,
    believing they were working with a trustworthy entity.
    This shift in perspective streamlined the entire sales process, as customers had already mentally purchased their
    vehicles before even speaking with a salesperson.
</p>
<h2>
    Skills & Learnings
</h2>
<p>
    The development of Dynamic Payments was a two-year journey. Through this period, I worked in various roles including
    sales call center representative, sales admin at the dealership,
    and inventory assistant in the corporate office. This multifaceted exposure allowed me to understand and address key
    issues in customer retention and steady sales growth.
    Through this experience, I honed my skills in software development, customer psychology, and the automotive
    industry.
